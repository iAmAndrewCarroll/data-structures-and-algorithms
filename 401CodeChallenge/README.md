## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- reverseArray
- It seems to be the most efficient way to reverse the array.
- Big O is O(n) and linear

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
<!-- def reverseArray(array):

  start = 0
  end = len(array) - 1

  while start < end:
    array[start], array[end] = array[end], array[start]
    start += 1
    end -= 1

  return array

array = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]

reverseArray(array)

print(array)` -->
